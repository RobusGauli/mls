# mls

Modern list file command for UNIX.

## Getting started

This project requires Go to be installed. On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.
It uses [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html) for dependency management.

Running it then should be as simple as:

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/mls
```

### Testing

``make test``
